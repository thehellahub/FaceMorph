Welcome to FaceMorph, a website to demonstrate some of the fun tutorials offered by opencv where you can mess with peoples' faces! How cool is that?! 

VIDEO DEMO:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoBeH_glbIo

INSTRUCTIONS:

Within the "site" directory are two files:

1.) things_I_needed.txt

2.) facemorph_server.py

REQUIREMENTS: 

things_I_needed.txt lists out all the packages needed to run the application. Additionally, I'm using the anaconda3 python package & interpreter, so I'm not sure of what additional packages you'll need other than what I've listed if you're not running an anaconda3 python installation. Lastly, I am running on a unix-based OS (macOS Catelina 10.15.7).

TO RUN:
python facemorph_server.py

Running the above should kick off the facemorph site. To visit, go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser.


Have fun and enjoy!
