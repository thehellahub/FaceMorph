1966: Humble beginnings

	- 	Marvin Minsky at MIT asked his undergraduate student Gerald Jay Sussman
		to “spend the summer linking a camera to a computer and getting the computer to describe
		what it saw” 


1970's: When computer vision first started out in the early 1970s, it was viewed as the
visual perception component of an ambitious agenda to mimic human intelligence and to
endow robots with intelligent behavior.

	- 	Digital image processing
	- 	Blocks world, line labeling
	- 	Generalized cylinders
	- 	Pattern recognition
	- 	Stereo correspondence
	- 	Intrinsic images
	- 	Optical flow
	- 	Structure from motion

1980's: In the 1980s, a lot of attention was focused on more sophisticated mathematical
techniques for performing quantitative image and scene analysis.

	- 	Image pyramids
	- 	Shape from shading, texture, and focus
	- 	Physically-based modeling
	- 	Regularization
	- 	Markov Random Fields
	- 	Kalman filters
	- 	3D range data processing

1990's: Newborn concepts become more active, taking on a more prominent role in computer vision.

	- 	Projective invariants
	- 	Factorization
	- 	Physics-based vision
	- 	Graph cuts
	- 	Particle filtering

2000's: This decade continued to deepen the interplay between the vision and graphics
fields, but more importantly embraced data-driven and learning approachs as core components
of vision.

	- 	Energy-based segmentation
	- 	Face recognition and detection
	- 	Image-based modeling and rendering
	- 	Texture synthesis and inpainting
	- 	Computational photography

2010's: The trend towards using large labeled (and also self-supervised) data sets to develop machine learning algorithms became a tidal wave that totally revolutionized the development of image recognition algorithms as well as other applications, such as denoising and optic flow, which previously used Bayesian and global optimization techniques.

	- 	Feature-based recognition
	- 	Category recognition
	- 	Machine learning
	- 	Modeling and tracking humans
	- 	Semantic segmentation
	- 	SLAM and VIO
	- 	Deep Learning

2020's: Incredible advances in the performance and reliability of computer vision algorithms, brought in part by the shift to machine learning and training on very large sets of real-world data. It has also seen the application of vision algorithms in myriad commercial and consumer scenarios.
